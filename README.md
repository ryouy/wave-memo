> **Text should not always remain.**

Wave Memo is a small experiment in disappearance.

Inspired by waves erasing writing from the shore,
this memo does not keep what you write.

At fixed intervals, a wave arrives.
The top line fades.
Then another.
Until nothing remains.

It is not a tool for saving.
It is a space for letting go.

## Statement

Digital systems are built for permanence.

Everything is stored.
Everything is retrievable.
Nothing truly disappears.

Wave Memo resists that assumption.

Here, writing is temporary.
Time is part of the interface.
Erasure is not an error — it is the behavior.

The memo is not a container.
It is a tide.

## A Quiet Choice

When you write, you stand at the shore.

You may let the waves take your words.
Or, if a thought feels worth keeping,
you must make a deliberate gesture —
a screenshot.

There is no save button.
No archive.
No history.

**Impermanence is the default.**
**Preservation requires intention.**

## Experience

* Lines fade, one by one
* Disappearance is visible, gradual
* No undo
* No persistence

The system does not accumulate.
It subtracts.
